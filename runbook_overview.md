# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Incident Runbook

## Overview
An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a long-term, targeted attack where an unauthorized party gains continuous access to a network, often remaining undetected for an extended period. This runbook provides a structured response to APT incidents, covering detection, analysis, containment, and recovery phases. Each phase includes detailed steps to effectively mitigate the impact of an APT attack.

## 1. Detection Phase

### Description
The detection phase focuses on identifying signs of long-term intrusion, such as persistent low-level network activity, which could indicate an APT attack.

### Steps to Detect
1. **Persistent Low-Level Network Activity**: Monitor for unusual and persistent network activity over time that doesn't match regular patterns.
2. **Anomalous User Behavior**: Use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect unexpected actions or unusual user activities that could indicate unauthorized access.
3. **Data Exfiltration Patterns**: Monitor outbound traffic for signs of slow and gradual data exfiltration, which is common in APT attacks.

### Scripts
- **`persistent_network_monitor.py`**: Script to monitor for persistent low-level network activity.
- **`anomalous_behavior_detector.py`**: Script to detect anomalous user behavior using behavioral analytics.
- **`data_exfiltration_detector.py`**: Script to monitor for patterns of data exfiltration.

## 2. Analysis Phase

### Description
The analysis phase focuses on gathering Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), analyzing malware samples, and identifying the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attacker.

### Steps to Analyze
1. **Gather IOCs**: Collect IOCs such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain names associated with the APT attack.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze any identified malware samples to understand their behavior, functionality, and impact.
3. **Identify TTPs**: Use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to map the tools, tactics, and procedures used by the attacker.

### Scripts
- **`ioc_collector.py`**: Script to gather Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- **`malware_analysis_tool.py`**: Script to automate the analysis of malware samples.
- **`ttp_identifier.py`**: Script to identify the attacker's TTPs using a framework like MITRE ATT&CK.

## 3. Containment Phase

### Description
The containment phase focuses on isolating affected systems and blocking communication with the attacker's Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to limit the damage.

### Steps to Contain
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**: Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Block C2 Communications**: Use network filtering and firewall rules to block communication with known Command and Control (C2) servers.
3. **Limit Lateral Movement**: Harden network segmentation to prevent lateral movement within the organization.

### Scripts
- **`isolate_systems.ps1`**: PowerShell script to isolate affected systems.
- **`block_c2_communications.sh`**: Bash script to block C2 communications by updating firewall rules.
- **`network_segmentation_hardener.py`**: Script to enhance network segmentation and prevent lateral movement.

## 4. Recovery Phase

### Description
The recovery phase focuses on eradicating backdoors, enhancing monitoring, and reviewing internal security to prevent future APT attacks.

### Steps to Recover
1. **Eradicate Backdoors**: Identify and remove all backdoors or unauthorized access points left by the attacker.
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Improve monitoring capabilities to detect similar threats in the future.
3. **Review Security Posture**: Conduct a review of internal security practices and update policies as needed to prevent recurrence.
4. **Patch Vulnerabilities**: Patch any vulnerabilities that were exploited during the attack.

### Scripts
- **`backdoor_removal_tool.py`**: Script to identify and remove backdoors from affected systems.
- **`enhance_monitoring_config.py`**: Script to enhance monitoring configurations.
- **`security_posture_reviewer.py`**: Script to review and update internal security policies.

## Flowchart
- Refer to the flowchart in the **/flowcharts/** directory for a visual representation of the APT response process, including detection, analysis, containment, and recovery workflows.

## Post-Incident Activities
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand how the APT attack occurred and determine necessary improvements.
- **Update Runbook**: Update this runbook with lessons learned to enhance future response.
- **Internal Training**: Provide training to security teams on recognizing and responding to APT attacks.

## Tools & References
- **SIEM Tools**: Use tools like Splunk or IBM QRadar to correlate security events and detect anomalies.
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: Use platforms like MISP to gather threat intelligence and IOCs related to the APT.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify TTPs used by the attacker.

## Summary
This runbook provides a structured approach to handling APT incidents, ensuring effective detection, analysis, containment, and recovery. By following these steps, SOC analysts can mitigate the impact of APT attacks and strengthen the organization's resilience against such threats.
