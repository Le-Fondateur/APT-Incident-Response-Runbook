# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Incident Response Runbook 🚨

## Overview 

An **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** is no ordinary cyberattack—it’s a stealthy, long-term infiltration by well-resourced adversaries who gain undetected access to networks for an extended period. The APT’s objective is to quietly gather intelligence, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations without raising alarms.

This **APT Incident Response Runbook** is your go-to guide for combating these silent invaders. From the initial detection of suspicious behavior to the final stages of system recovery, this runbook equips you with a structured and actionable process to secure your network. With detailed scripts and practical steps, it’s designed for real-world application by cybersecurity teams facing the challenge of APT attacks.

## Phases of the Runbook 🚦

### 1. **Detection Phase** 🔍
Identifying the quiet steps of an adversary is key to containing an APT before damage is done. In this phase, we focus on recognizing the subtle signs of long-term intrusion:
- **Monitor Low-Level Network Activity**: Look for persistent, unusual activity that flies under the radar.
- **Detect Anomalous User Behavior**: Use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to catch suspicious actions.
- **Identify Data Exfiltration Patterns**: Keep an eye on outbound traffic to catch slow, stealthy data theft.

**Scripts Included**:
- `persistent_network_monitor.py` - Monitors network traffic patterns for anomalies.
- `anomalous_behavior_detector.py` - Detects unusual user actions using behavior analytics.
- `data_exfiltration_detector.py` - Tracks slow data exfiltration attempts.

### 2. **Analysis Phase** 🧠
Now that you’ve detected a potential threat, it’s time to investigate. The analysis phase digs deeper into indicators of compromise (IoCs) and traces the attacker’s steps:
- **Examine IoCs**: Investigate any suspicious behavior, files, or logs that may point to an APT.
- **Correlate Logs**: Trace the steps of the attacker by correlating network and system logs.

**Scripts Included**:
- `log_correlation_tool.py` - Aggregates and analyzes log files for deeper insights.
- `ioc_investigator.py` - Examines Indicators of Compromise to map the attack path.

---

### 3. **Containment Phase** 🛡️
Once you’ve confirmed the threat, it’s time to limit the damage. The containment phase focuses on stopping the attack in its tracks:
- **Isolate Affected Systems**: Cut off the attacker’s access by isolating compromised machines.
- **Disable Compromised Accounts**: Temporarily restrict access for suspicious user accounts.
- **Collect Forensic Data**: Gather critical evidence for further analysis.

**Scripts Included**:
- `network_isolation_tool.py` - Automates the isolation of infected segments.
- `forensic_data_collector.py` - Collects forensic data for in-depth analysis.

---

### 4. **Eradication Phase** 🔥
Now it’s time to remove the threat for good. The eradication phase ensures that all traces of the attacker are wiped clean:
- **Malware Removal**: Scan and clean all compromised systems.
- **Patch Vulnerabilities**: Fix any weaknesses that were exploited by the attacker.

**Scripts Included**:
- `malware_removal_tool.py` - Automates malware scanning and removal.
- `vulnerability_patcher.py` - Identifies and patches vulnerabilities in the system.

---

### 5. **Recovery Phase** 🚀
The final step is to restore your systems and fortify your defenses. In this phase, the focus is on getting back to normal operations while ensuring the attacker doesn’t return:
- **System Restoration**: Recover compromised systems from secure backups.
- **Post-Incident Monitoring**: Keep a close eye on the network for signs of reinfection.
- **Incident Review**: Conduct a thorough review to prevent future incidents.

**Scripts Included**:
- `system_restore_validator.py` - Ensures that restored systems are free from infection.
